# Game-Manager-App
Built a full stack app using React + Express by following a React course tutorial. Included zustand, React Query, React Hook Form and React Query.
*NOTE: I added the invalidating queries and handleDelete functionalities in the GameList component and the "Add Game" link on homepage by myself.
